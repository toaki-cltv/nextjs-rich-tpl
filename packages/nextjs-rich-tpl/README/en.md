We recommend starting a new Next.js application using `nextjs-rich-tpl`. To create a project, run:

```bash
npx nextjs-rich-tpl
```

After installation, you will see the following prompts:

```bash
Select a Next.js template:
‚ùØ Next.js app with i18n routing setup

Enter your project name: (my-nextjs-app) 
```

After the prompts, `nextjs-rich-tpl` will create a folder with your project name and install the necessary dependencies.
